# ULX Karma Betting
## THIS PLUGIN IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN GERMAN AND NOT FINISHED! THIS NOTICE WILL BE REMOVED UPON FINISHED TRANSLATION AND IMPROVED FUNCTIONALITY

## What it is for
This plugin can be installed on Garry's Mod servers to enable betting of Karma while being dead or spectating.

## What it does
Players are able to bet their karma when they're dead or spectating. The living players are being updated live on the counters, but don't see who bet. They only see the total amount of bets placed. After 3 minutes (by default) the betting process ends. On round end the winners/losers are picked and the winners are rewarded while the losers lose all of the karma they bet.
